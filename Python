Welcome to my journey through Replit’s 100 Days of Code challenge using Python!  
This repo documents my progress, starting from Day 1.

📅 Date
April 19, 2025

 🧠 What I Learned Today

- How to write and run Python code on Replit.
- How to use the `print()` function.
- Learned to print multiple lines and format them using triple quotes (`"""`).
- Discovered how to add emojis and strings together in Python.
- Got introduced to the idea of coding every day for 100 days!

🧾 My Code

python
print("Anuj Nalawade")
print("19/4/25")
print("""I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be.
No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!""")
print("I'm feeling 😁")
print("You can follow my progress at replit.com/@AnujNalawade")
