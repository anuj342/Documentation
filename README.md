📘 My Learning Journey – Programming, Cybersecurity & More

Welcome to my personal coding and cybersecurity learning log!  
This repository tracks my daily progress and hands-on practice across multiple domains including:

🐍 Python – Core concepts, scripting, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
💻 C Programming – Low-level logic, memory handling, and fundamentals
🌐 Networking – Protocols, layers, and traffic analysis
🐧 Kali Linux – Cybersecurity tools, commands, and practical labs
🔍 Log Analysis – Investigating logs for anomalies, incidents, and threats
🔓 Web Application Pentesting – Finding and exploiting common vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, etc.)

🧰 Tools I'm Using & Learning

Here are some of the key tools I’m working with across different domains:

🕵️ Network Analysis           Wireshark, Nmap 
🔐 Vulnerability Scanning     Nessus, SQLMap 
🧠 OSINT & Mapping            Maltego 
🌐 Web App Testing            Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP 
🧰 General Pentesting         Kali Linux toolset, custom Python scripts 

📅 Why I’m Doing This

I believe in learning by doing. This repo is a reflection of my effort to become a better programmer and cybersecurity professional through:

💡 Daily practice
📚 Deep dives into topics
🛠️ Building tools & automation scripts
📈 Tracking growth over time

🚀 Topics I’ll Cover Over Time

Python (scripting, automation, DSA)
C programming (core concepts)
Networking (OSI/TCP-IP model, Wireshark, etc.)
Linux & shell scripting (mainly Kali)
Log forensics & investigation
Web app vulnerabilities & ethical hacking

Stay tuned for new folders, notes, and code updates regularly.
