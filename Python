Welcome to my journey through Replit’s 100 Days of Code challenge using Python!  
This repo documents my progress, starting from Day 1.

📅 Date
April 19, 2025

 🧠 What I Learned Today

- How to write and run Python code on Replit.
- How to use the `print()` function.
- Learned to print multiple lines and format them using triple quotes (`"""`).
- Discovered how to add emojis and strings together in Python.
- Got introduced to the idea of coding every day for 100 days!

🧾 My Code

python
print("Anuj Nalawade")
print("19/4/25")
print("""I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be.
No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!""")
print("I'm feeling 😁")
print("You can follow my progress at replit.com/@AnujNalawade")

📅 Day 2 - Python Practice (Phishing Awareness Script)

🧠 Concepts Covered
Input and Output in Python
String formatting
Variable usage
Practicing identifying bad coding habits in a humorous way
Basic user interaction simulation
Awareness around social engineering and phishing

🛠️ Task
We were given a poorly written and suspicious script meant to simulate a phishing scam (purely for educational purposes). The goal was to:
Fix syntax and logic errors in the provided code
Learn how to use input() and print() properly
Understand how sensitive information could be misused if shared carelessly

✅ What I Did
Fixed incorrect variable names and typos
Properly used input() to get the user’s name, credit card number, and mother’s maiden name
Corrected formatting issues (unnecessary or broken print() calls)
Ensured output flows logically and clearly
Added line breaks for better readability

🧪 Final Output Example
vbnet
Copy code
Definitely not a Phishing Scam
Your Name: Anuj
Thanks for logging in
Anuj
What is your credit card number? 1234 1563 1345 1345
Thanks, I definitely won't put
1234 1563 1345 1345
into Amazon and order anything weird.
Promise
What is your Mother's maiden name? Anna

That's cool, I just wanted to know that Anna was your Mum's maiden name. Not because the bank requested it or anything honest.

🔐 Security Lesson
This task, although playful, highlighted the dangers of:
Giving away sensitive information online
Trusting unknown or suspicious prompts
The importance of being cautious and aware of phishing attempts

💡 What I Learned
How to handle user input effectively
Good vs. bad practices when writing interactive scripts
How easy it is to manipulate users with seemingly harmless code
Never to trust programs asking for credit card details or personal info unless verified
